CookEasy – Visual-Based Cooking App

CookEasy is a mobile app designed to help non-verbal learners follow simple cooking routines at home. It uses PECS-style visual cards and step-by-step guidance, with an optional caregiver role for support.

This was developed as my Final Year Project (Cognitive Science, UNIMAS), combining accessible UX, behavioral task routines, and mobile tech.

🧠 Key Features
-  Visual task board (To Do → Doing → Done)
- Learner & caregiver roles (Firebase Auth)
- Works offline once routines are cached
- Custom PECS‑style icon set
- In‑app lesson plans + downloadable PDFs

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- Dart
- Figma (for design planning)

🧪 Testing
Reviewed by experts in ICT and cognitive psychology to assess clarity, usability, and cognitive accessibility of the app’s core routines.
